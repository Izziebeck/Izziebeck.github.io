       <h1>An “Ordinary” Corner on 125th Street: The Magic Johnson Movie Theaters</h1>
       <p id="essay">On an inconspicuous corner of Frederick Douglass Boulevard sits the Magic Johnson movie theater. It is no grand spectacle. It’s a regular AMC theater. The architecture of the building is not profound in any way. The history of the theater is not very well known. The movie seats are ok and maybe even a little uncomfortable, and the snacks are, as usual, overpriced. The walk to the theater from the 125th Street subway station is also not terribly special. Crowded streets and hot dog vendors make up this scene, as they do on many blocks in the city. Yes, just a few hundred feet down 125th you can see the famous Apollo Ttheater! And further west lies the Cotton Club. But their heyday is long past and nobody seems to have taken great care of them. ‘Meh’ or ‘So what?!’ might be appropriate thoughts from the many rushed New Yorkers walking by. No NYC tourism book includes coverage of the AMC Magic Johnson Harlem 9 movie theater. Nor of the nearby deli, street vendor, or hair salon. </p>
       <p id="essay">This not so seemingly special place (to both New Yorkers and outsiders), however, is the most enjoyable place to watch a movie. The regular excitement of watching a movie is amplified greatly by the community, the people, and the surroundings. On February 16th, 2019, opening night of Black Panther, the excitement created in a screening room of the Magic Johnson theater was unparalleled to any other excitement in the entire cinematic universe, arguably even the whole damn universe. Unlike movie watchers elsewhere, the people in the theater interacted with the screen as if these 2D fictional characters were real and literally 30 or so feet away from them. The connection created over the movie's characters, the openness of people’s feelings, and the unfiltered spoken thoughts of the audience members were all a part of the community make-up in the Magic Johnson theater. For these 135 minutes, we laughed, we cried, we gasped, we yelled. This screening room somehow connected all the strangers inside and teleported them away from their daily, mundane experiences to the magical kingdom of “Wakanda” in Black Panther. No living room or suburban movie theater could replicate this experience. The energy created in the Magic Johnson movie theater is so unique and is still quintessentially New York, but it is related, ironically, to the surrounding, not-so-special area. </p>
       <p id="essay">The history of Harlem, and specifically of the Harlem renaissance, is extremely rich, profound, and robust, and its impact is still felt not only in New York but throughout America. James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Billie Holiday, and Louis Armstrong are a few of the many iconic artists of the Harlem Renaissance that ignited an intellectual and artistic explosion that was experienced by the whole nation. While many traditional careers were closed to Black people because of prejudice, the arts provided writers, musicians, and painters in Harlem with a unique way to shape their own lives and wider American culture. They created innovative art forms which changed the structures of writing and music. Hughes’ poetry and short stories have an on-the-street feel and seem to perfectly capture the conversations of real people. Jazz, an emerging music genre at that time, emphasized connections between the artists and the audience and between the artists themselves. Songs like “The Skeleton in the Closet” by Louis Armstrong have an engaging feeling and use the style of “call and response” to do so. A questioning phrase coming from a saxophone calls for a subsequent answer from possibly the piano or even the audience. These art forms create affirmation and intimacy, which were absent from other American music at the time. The Harlem Renaissance is of course preserved in the works of Hughes and of Armstrong, and in the spaces of the Apollo Theater and the Cotton Club, but the heart of this historic period remains in the city and within its people. The Harlem Renaissance changed the American experience and specifically the New York experience. While every New Yorker can feel and cherish this experience created by the Harlem Renaissance, this experience, culture, and celebration belongs to the Black people in America, and even more so Black New Yorkers and locals of Harlem. And although it may not appear so, this history is also now preserved in the community, gathering, and surroundings of the ordinary Magic Johnson Movie Theater. </p>
       <p id="essay">For those who are not from Harlem, the environment of the Magic Johnson movie theater may be a deviation from one’s usual surroundings. For many people, this unfamiliar environment deters them from returning. However, as I continue to keep traveling down to the theater, occasionally meeting friends on the A train, walking by hotdog and pretzel stands, and finally stepping into the lovely buttery popcorn aroma of the theater, it is obvious that the Magic Johnson movie theater is my favorite of New York destinations. The Magic Johnson Theaters combine for me a very familiar, mainstream experience (going to the movies), with an unfamiliar environment, moviegoers who are more actively engaged with what they're experiencing. The community in the theaters do not sit passively by and quietly absorb the sounds and images of the movie. They interact with the movie, creating a memorable experience. The Magic Johnson movie theater is a staple to my New York because I enjoy escaping to a unique environment and amazing community combined with the familiar comfort of watching a movie.</p>
